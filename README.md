Create a simple API, that allows you to make a booking for given dates, manage capacity
(number of free spaces) and an option to check if there’s a car parking space available.

date range.

Weekday/Weekend Pricing, Summer/Winter Pricing)
- Customers should be able to create a booking for given dates (from - to)
- Customers should be able to cancel their booking.
